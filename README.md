# Magic Square Kata

The magic part of this puzzle is when the values on a square are arranged so that adding them up in any direction results in a constant sum.

You have the following values:

```
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
7, 8, 9
```

You need to arrange them in a 3x3 matrix so that:

1. The sums of numbers in each row = magic number
2. The sums of numbers in each column = magic number
3. The sums of numbers in each diagonal = magic number

## Requirements

- Your objective is to complete a function that receives an 3x3 two-dimensional array with 9 consecutive numbers (sorted or unsorted) and returns the same array with the numbers correctly positioned.
